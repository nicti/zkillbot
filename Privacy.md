# Privacy Policy for zKillBot

**Effective Date:** October 4th, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 4th, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **zKillBot** ("the Bot", "we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and stores information when interacting with users through Discord.  
By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

zKillBot is a Discord integration that posts EVE Online killmails and related data to Discord channels, based on subscriptions created by server administrators.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

The Bot collects and stores **only the minimum information necessary** to function properly:

- **Guild IDs** and **Channel IDs** — to know which servers and channels the Bot should post to.  
- **Command Usage** — when a user with *Manage Channel* permission checks status or creates subscriptions.  
- **Subscription Data** — information about which EVE entities are subscribed to (e.g., corporation, alliance, character IDs).  
- **Post History** — a limited record of previous posts to prevent duplicate postings to the same channel.

No personal user information (such as real names, emails, IP addresses, or messages) is collected, processed, or stored by the Bot.

---

## 3. How We Use the Information

Collected data is used exclusively to:

- Deliver EVE Online killmail updates to subscribed Discord channels.  
- Prevent duplicate notifications.  
- Maintain functional records of where and how the Bot is configured.

We **do not sell, share, or use** any of this data for analytics, advertising, or any purpose unrelated to the operation of the Bot.

---

## 4. Data Retention

Data such as guild IDs, channel IDs, and post history are retained **only as long as necessary** to provide Bot functionality.  
If the Bot is removed from a Discord server, all related configuration and historical data are automatically or periodically deleted.

---

## 5. User Control & Removal

- Discord server administrators can remove the Bot from their server at any time.  
- Once removed, the Bot no longer has access to that server or any of its channels.  
- Stored configuration data tied to that server will be purged in the normal cleanup cycle.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services

zKillBot interacts with:
- **EVE Online / CCP Games** — to retrieve killmail and entity information.
- **https://zkillredisq.stream/** - [RedisQ](https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ) for polling of killmails that have been retrieved via https://zkillboard.com
- **Discord** — to send and receive data via the Discord API.

All EVE Online intellectual property, including names, logos, and related materials, are the property of **CCP Games**.  
zKillBot is not affiliated with or endorsed by CCP Games.

---

## 7. Security

We take reasonable steps to secure stored data and prevent unauthorized access.  
However, users should understand that no online system is entirely free of risk.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The Bot is not intended for children under 13 years of age and should only be used in compliance with Discord’s own Terms of Service.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.  
When changes are made, the “Last Updated” date above will be revised, and updated versions will be made publicly available.
